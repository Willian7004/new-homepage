[verse]

Velvet shadows cling to the neon-lit墙

Sultry saxophone hums a whispered prayer

Your cigarette smolders like a secret I know

The piano’s confession, but your lips won’t say more

[chorus]

Lay your shadow down on this moonlit hour

Let the whiskey and rhythm unravel the fire

Every scar we tasted, every name we erased

Drowns in the amber glow of the bartender’s pyre
