[verse]

Sub-bass growl hits like a rattlin’ freight train

I’m the wound that scabs but never loses pain

Cash rules, but my pen’s the sharper blade

Scars on my soul, but I’m risin’ anyway

[chorus]

Throne of steel, fists of fire

I’m the crack in the code, the glitch in the wire

Yo, you feel that 808 heartbeat?

I’m the ghost in the machine—watch me dissect the street
