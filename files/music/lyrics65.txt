[verse]

Fading echoes in the hollow halls of dusk

Dust motes dance where your shadow once curled up

A symphony of unspoken words suspended

In the cracks of an old piano’s restless breath

[chorus]

I am the ghost in your peripheral vision

The hum that lingers when the final note fades

Every photograph weathers but your smile’s edges

Hold galaxies I still haven’t escaped
