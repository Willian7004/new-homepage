[verse]

Neon veins pulse in the dark, circuits hum alive

Future's whisper in my ear, breaking through the noise

Gravity’s just a game when I feel the synth’s embrace

Wires in the sky write my name with electric grace

[chorus]

Ignite the flame, we’re racing through the wires

Code and soul collide, burning brighter than desire

You can’t outrun this rhythm now

I’m the spark you can’t hide now

Futuristic heartbeats rise higher

We won’t back down
