[verse]

Fist meets steel in a tempest of sparks

The amplifier screams as the darkness stirs

Rage like a hurricane, no mercy in the sound

We are the storm that the earth cannot ground

[chorus]

We'll carve our names on the bones of the damned

Electric hellfire, our battle hymn screamed

No surrender, just the blade in our veins

Till the last wire snaps, we'll butcher the chains
