[verse]

Dawn breaks through the city’s glass, a sparkling start

My pulse syncs with the synth beats, rewriting my heart

Through shadows of last night’s doubt, I trace the light

Now every chord I play whispers, "You’re burning so bright"

[chorus]

Rise with the synth waves tonight, let the keys ignite the sound

We’re galaxies in motion, breaking every chain we’ve found

Feel the rhythm ascend like a phoenix in flight

I’m your steady melody—dancing through the stormy night
