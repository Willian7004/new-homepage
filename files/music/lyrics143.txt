[verse]

Steel rhythms pulse through these wired-up bones

Smoke curls from the tires where the asphalt moans

I carved my truth in feedback from the amp

Now the static’s alive and it’s screaming my name

[chorus]

Every rule you write I’ll burn in gasoline

Every law you enforce I’ll bend it unseen

Let the drums crack like lightning through my shattered frame

Feel the rebellion roar—I won’t be tamed
