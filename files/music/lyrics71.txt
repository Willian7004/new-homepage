[verse]

Dawn breaks gentle, whispers in the light

Your voice echoes through the night

Fingers trace the melody we shared

Promises in every note we’ve played

[chorus]

You’re the spark that ignites the flame

In every chord, you’re my guiding name

When shadows fade, you’ll shine so bright

You won’t fade, you’ll rise again

You won’t bend, you’ll dance unseen

The world may change, but you remain
