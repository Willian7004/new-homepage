[verse]

Sand between my toes, waves whisper my name

Palm trees sway slow, the rhythm of the game

We danced in the rain, barefoot under the moon

Now I’m chasing the breeze where your laughter’s in bloom

[chorus]

Oh oh oh, you’re the salt in my sea

Oh oh oh, wild as the tide’s melody

Wherever you go, I’ll follow the sun

Let the coconut breeze carry us home, honey, we’re never undone
