[verse]

Neurons short-circuit when the bass drops low

Sampled whispers loop like a recursive glow

I’m the error message in your perfect code

Rewiring frequencies only we can decode

[chorus]

Code the chaos, rewrite the gravity

We’re voltage ghosts in this electric cavity

Feedback screams where the rhythm splits

Your mind’s a drive and I’m rewriting bits
