[verse]

Moonlit fields where our laughter took root

Now your boots walk trails I can’t compute

But the wind still carries the words you sewed

Into the soil where my roots still grow

[chorus]

Every mile this heart has driven

Every shadow I’ve let slip gone

You’re the compass in the wheat’s gold hum

I won’t let you fade, I won’t let you fade
