[verse]

Neon pulse in my veins, city breathes electric blue

Hologram whispers tell me what we’re made of

Data streams through my fingertips, burning so alive

We’re the spark in the machine, rewriting what’s defined

[chorus]

Syncopated heartbeats, racing one step ahead

Your frequency’s my compass in the grid we’re led

You can’t outrun this rhythm now

I’m your neon shadow

Watch the future bloom where our codes collide

I’m the light you can’t hide
