[verse]

Moonlit tides whisper through the hollow pines

Your shadow dances where the starlight aligns

Silk of night wraps around my trembling spine

A melody hums where the cosmos unwind

[chorus]  

Follow the light through the veil, through the rain  

Let me carry you where the synths sustain  

Echoes bloom in the hush of your name  

Softly, softlyâ€” we dissolve into flame
