[verse]

Riffs like shattered glass in my veins

Bassline claws through the static pain

Blood and thunder in every chord

We are the storm they’re forced to ignore

[chorus]

Crash through walls where shadows scream!

Bass and riff, the earth will bleed—

Every scream, every strike, we’re the lawless breath!

In the maelstrom we drown the sun

No surrender, no grave, just chaos begun
