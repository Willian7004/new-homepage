[verse]

Neon veins pulse through a city on fire

Fists raised high, we scream "no more lies"

The system’s a cage, but we chew through the steel

Spit out the rules etched in rust on our kneecaps

[chorus]  

We are the crack in the mirror they can't ignore  

The acid that burns every sacred "before"  

You want us to kneel? Nah, we’ll swallow the sun  

Watch us rise from the ashes, unbroken, undone  

Every chain we’ve erased howls louder than guns  

We won’t back down!
