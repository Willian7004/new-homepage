[verse]

Sandal tracks in the sand, dreadlocks catching the breeze  

Palm trees whispering secrets only the ocean believes  

I chased the wrong waves but I’m learning to ride  

The rhythm of failure, now I’m dancing with pride  

[chorus]

Don’t follow the rules, let the bassline steal your feet  

We’re chasing the sun where the horizon meets  

This sunny rebellion, a slow-burning flame  

I won’t bend for the system, just hum the bassline’s name
