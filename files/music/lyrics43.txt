[verse]

Dusk settles like a whisper low  

Your voice in the echo, I can’t let go  

Notes of courage hum through the rain  

A melody blooms where shadows remain  

[chorus]  

Let the stars ignite your path tonight  

Every shadow fades, we’re dancing in the light  

Let the sky embrace the fire you’ve been keeping   

No more chains, we’re soaring—let it all begin
