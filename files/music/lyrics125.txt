[verse]

Neon drips like tears on the jukejoint wall  

Your shadow lingers where the whiskey falls  

Old slide whispers secrets through the dust  

A thousand photos, none of us, just rust  

[chorus]

I’ll follow your shadow ‘til the road runs cold  

Every note I play is a ghost you hold  

The blues don’t lie, they wear your face  

In the smoke and static, I’m your endless chase
