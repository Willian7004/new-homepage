[verse]

Moonlight whispers through the keys I play tonight

Fingertips trace melodies that bloom in starlight

Your laughter’s a rhythm, the synth hums your name

In every chord I’m building a bridge for us to claim

[chorus]

I’ll be the sunrise chasing the shadows from your face

The steady pulse in your veins when the world feels too vast

When the doubts try to rise, I’ll melt them with this sound

Turn every fragile moment into something profound

Oh you can’t outrun the love that’s burning in the wires

It’s in every note we orbit, forever colliding
