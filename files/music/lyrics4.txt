[verse]

Midnight keys whisper through foggy lines

Your silhouette dances in the velvet vines

A melody in your sighs, half-written verse

We’re ink and paper blurred in reverse

[chorus]

I’ll trace the shadows where your footsteps sway

In the silence between notes, I’ll follow the maze

When reality bends and the colors bleed

I’m the ghost note humming, the dream you feed
