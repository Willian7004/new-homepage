[verse]

Candlelight trembles through stained glass designs

Echoes of psalms rise where the shadows entwine

Stone arches hold whispers of centuries past

A silent confession where my soul finds its mast

[chorus]  

Celestial harmonies carve through the air

Voices in minor keys lift my sinew and bone

You are the hymn that the heavens compose

An eternal refrain in the marrow of stones  

Iâ€™ll kneel where the incense dissolves into time

Let gothic vowels carve my trembling spine

Your shadow the altar, your breath the last psalm

A fractured devotion still yearning to calm
