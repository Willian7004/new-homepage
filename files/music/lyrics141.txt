[verse]

Old pines whisper the tales of our youth

Your voice lingers in the dusk’s soft hue

I let the seasons steal what we couldn’t hold

Now autumn leaves trace the path we once followed

[chorus]  

Return to the wild where the cello sighs  

Every note’s a river, every breath a sigh  

Let the stars rewrite the words we left behind  

In the flute’s fragile rhyme, we’ll intertwine
