[verse]

Silent breath of twilight, shadows weave through trees

A whispered wind carries the pulse of unseen seas

Rivers trace their silver paths where the earth and sky align

A fragile hymn of ancient light in the quiet of the mind

[chorus]

Beneath the weightless sky, we drift in endless blue

A dance of dust and starlight, in the breath we never knew

No beginning, no ending, just the pulse beneath our feet

The world dissolves to echoes where the heart forgets to beat
