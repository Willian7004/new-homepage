[verse]

Moonlight strings trace shadows on the wall

Your name still lingers in the falling rain

Piano keys weep sonatas of the past

A viola’s breath where our vows dissolved at last

[chorus]

Silk-voiced echoes cling to trembling air

Every note a scar I cannot bear to name

You were adagio’s fire, now ash in my throat

We’re a symphony of almosts, forever incomplete
