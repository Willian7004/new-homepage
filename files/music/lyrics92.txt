[verse]

Dust on the porch swing where your laughter still clings  

Strumming the chords you played on that faded guitar string  

Your denim overalls hung where the locust tree bends  

Now the fields whisper your name in the golden October winds  

[chorus]  

We’re just shadows where the creek meets the highway at dusk  

You swore you’d stay till the stars kissed the rust on our truck  

These calloused hands trace the maps of your weathered palm  

Time’s a river but love’s that stubborn oak in the storm
