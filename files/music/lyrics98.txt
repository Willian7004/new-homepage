[verse]

Tactical mind sharp as a switchblade's edge

Diamond eyes scanning crowds, I own this street's ledge

Base-knocking beats, my flow’s a freight train wreck

Scratched knees turned to gold, yeah the grind don’t stop for checks

[chorus]

Thunderclap in the chest, I’m the storm you can’t contain

Every syllable’s a bullet, leave empires in the rain

Bow to the fire that never dies, never chains

This kingdom built on scars – I’m the king of the remains
