[verse]

Whispers of the night cling to a rusted harmonica sigh  

Barrel-aged regrets swirl in whiskey’s amber glow  

I traced the cracks in time where your laughter used to hide  

Now just echoes in the backseat of a broken Ford’s slow crawl  

[chorus]  

Every shadow you cast, I’ll trace it mile by mile  

Every scar your heart etched, I’ll wear like a saints’ shrine  

You can’t outrun these rails, these tracks on bleeding ground  

I’m the ghost in your rearview, the blues we both decry
