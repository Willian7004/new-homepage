[verse]

Rusty veins pulse with white-hot rage

Fists of static tear through the cage

Feedback screams through shattered glass

We are the wound that refuses to close

[chorus]

Break every chain but the ones we wear

Drown in the fire we can't escape

Fists raised high in defiant war

WE ARE THE SCAR THAT KILLS THE SKIN

WE ARE THE SCAR THAT KILLS THE SKIN
