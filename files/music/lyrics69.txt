[verse]

Two hearts in the static, 8-bit skies  

Rewind these memories, delete the lies  

The city breathes in RGB waves tonight  

I’m chasing echoes through the analog light  

[chorus]  

Every frame you fade, I’ll pixelate your name  

Every love you lose, I’ll burn it in the flame  

You can’t outrun this frequency now  

I’ll pulse beneath your rhythm now  

You know your code’s entangled now  

I’ll never let you crash this hour
