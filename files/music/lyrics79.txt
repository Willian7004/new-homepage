[verse]

Dust settles on the porch swing where we used to sway

Sunset paints the silhouette of your name today

An old guitar hums in the corner, strings worn thin

Now the hinges whisper your name where the shadows begin

[chorus]

Timeâ€™s a river carrying memories downstream

But some embers glow in the dusk like June

We were fireflies in the dark, burning slow and bright

Now the night holds our echoes, tangled in the light
