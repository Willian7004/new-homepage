[verse]

Velvet shadows drape the moonlit pavement

Cigarette smoke whispers, *"We still got time*"

Your laugh’s a saxophone sigh in my chest cavity

Syncopated heartbeats, we’re two chords meshed

[chorus]

I’m the shadow that clings when your spotlight fades

The bassline hums your name in the underground

Every turn you take, I’m the echo that stays

In the smoke-filled silence, we’re entwined somehow
