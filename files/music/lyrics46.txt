[verse]

The bow weeps a melody that the cold winds erase

Our promises unravel like threads in empty space

I trace the fractures where your laughter used to bloom

Now autumn’s breath surrounds me, a hollow, endless room

[chorus]

Every note you play, I’ll be the ache in the strings

Every tear you cry, I’m the shadow of your wings

You can’t outrun this silence now

I won’t let you fade

You know it’s written in the dust

I won’t let you fade
