[verse]

City lights blaze, asphalt pulses in time

Footsteps crack concrete, rhythm fuels my climb

Heartbeat syncs with the bass, no room for a lie

I run the track where the shadows and I collide

[chorus]

Every stride you make, I’m the thunder behind

Every mile you claim, watch my fire ignite

You can’t outrun this tempo now

I won’t back down

Feel the ground shake, I’m the roar in your lungs

You can’t deny it now

I won’t back down
