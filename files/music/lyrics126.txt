[verse]

Shattered bones scream in the static of the storm

Fists of rage claw at the wires wrapped around my form

Feedback howls where your whispers used to crawl

Now I’m the ghost in the machine, gnawing through the thrall

[chorus]

Bleed through the silence! I AM THE CRACK IN YOUR ORDER

Crush the hollow hymns with teeth of fractured border

You built this prison? Watch me MELT THE KEYS TO DUST

Every scream’s a war cry, every breath a rusted rust
