[verse]

Dust on my boots, harmonica's mournful cry

Slide guitar whispers through the midnight sky

Old wounds still bleed where the whiskey won't lie

These roads we rode on got no turning back

[chorus]

Every note I play’s a ghost you can’t outrun

Every crack in the highway’s where we begun

You can’t bury this ache in a faded song

I’m still here, baby, still fighting the wrong
