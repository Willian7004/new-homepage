[verse]

Smoldering shadows on the piano's breath

A minor chord lingers where your voice fell

Velvet silence stitches every crack

But the double bass growls through the black

[chorus]

SHATTER THE VEIL OF THIS SILENT WAR

SCREAM THROUGH THE STATIC THAT BINDS US TIGHT

EACH STRING'S A KNIFE IN THE PULSING DARK

WE FEED THE FIRE TILL THE SKY GOES BLOODY BRIGHT

(NO REST IN THE RHYTHM - NO MERCY IN THE MELODY)

THE BONES OF THE BEATS ARE BREAKING NOW

THEYâ€™LL FIND US IN THE FEEDBACK

WHERE THE MELANCHOLY DIES AND THE METAL ROARS
