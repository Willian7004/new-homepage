[verse]

Neon whispers trace the fog on my whiskey glass  

Your silhouette sways in the haze like a slow dance  

Silk sheets remember what the morning forgets  

Midnight hums a blues I can’t forget  

[chorus]  

Your shadow’s a saxophone in my chest  

Playing chords that haunt every breath I suppress  

The moon’s a spotlight on this endless tango  

You’re the pulse in my veins, I’m the shadow you cast along
