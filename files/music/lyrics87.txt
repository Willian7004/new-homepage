[verse]

Beneath the fractured dawn where shadows claw the light,

We carved our names in stone, defying endless night.

Through tempests we have sailed, with courage as our guide,

Now stand at timeâ€™s edge trembling, yet unbroken pride.

[chorus]

With every step we rise, the stars align as one,

From ashes of our fall, the eternal flame is won.

No chains can hold this soul, no war can break our stance,

We are the echo of tomorrow's thunderous advance.
