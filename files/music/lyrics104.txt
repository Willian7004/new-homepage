[verse]

Steel clashes like thunder, blood paints the ancient earth

Eyes of the damned gleam through the smoke's cursed birth

Fists of iron shatter every bone, every spine

Screams carve the darkness where the forgotten divine

[chorus]

Rise on broken wings, claw through the embers born

Unchain the inferno from the shattered throne

I won’t kneel where shadows gnaw the light's last breath

In the void's cold maw, we scream until we’re death
