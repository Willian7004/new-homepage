[verse]

Fingertips stained with rust and gasoline rain

Screaming into the silence, no one hears my name

The static in my veins screams "run, but where?"

A ghost in a trench coat, choking on empty air

[chorus]

Break me down to the bones, watch the cracks in the ground

I'll carve my rage into stone, let the echoes resound

You can't bury this wildfire now

I won't back down

Every scar's a battle cry

I'll scream it loud
