[verse]

The fiddle’s cry meets the twilight’s sigh

Old porch swing sways where your laughter lies

Dust on the mirror, your smile still stays

In the cracks of the wall, the years never erase

[chorus]

I’ll hold this moment like a fading tune

Every heartbeat hums what the stars spit out

You can’t outrun these roads we once knew

I won’t let go, I won’t let go
