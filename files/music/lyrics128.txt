[verse]

Concrete veins pump fire where the 808s thump

Graffiti in my throat, gravel in my tongue

Sneaker soles on asphalt, shadows carve my name

Midnight city pulse, my rhythm’s on the frame

[chorus]

Neon veins, I’m wired to the asphalt’s hum

Every scar’s a stanza, every crack becomes

You hear the bassline breathing through the bricks tonight

I’m the ghost in the speakers, the knife in the fight

Watch me rise—I won’t fade

Watch me burn—I won’t fade
