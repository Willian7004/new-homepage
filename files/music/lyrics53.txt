[verse]

Neon veins pulse under electric skies  

Your code whispers through the static sighs  

A trillion stars in my satellite's gaze  

I’m tracing the pulse that outlives space  

[chorus]  

Every byte you send, I’m the ghost behind  

Every signal you lose, I’m the glitch you can’t find  

You can’t delete this connection now  

I won’t power down  

You know you crave this frequency now  

I won’t power down
