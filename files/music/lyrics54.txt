[verse]

Soft keys whisper through midnight's velvet air  

Your shadow lingers in the smoke and wine  

A caramel sigh melts on the tip of my tongue  

We’re ghosts in the jazz club, half-remembered things  

  

[chorus]  

Spin me slow in the flicker of candlelight  

Let the melody drown what we almost held tight  

You said "darlin', the notes fade but the rhythm stays"  

I’ll hum our requiem where the stars sway
