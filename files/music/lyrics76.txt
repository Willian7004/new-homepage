[verse]

Moonlight spills on the keys of the piano  

Smoke curls slow where your shadow still lingers  

A gin fizz hums in a crystal highball  

Velvet shadows whisper your name every night  

[chorus]  

Saxophone sighs in the amber haze  

Weâ€™re two notes dancing in the same lazy phrase  

No rush to resolve this suspended chord  

Let the silence bloom where your laughter was stored
