[verse]

Crystalline fractures ripple through the code

Binary rain dissolves the flesh I owed

You’re a glitch in the system, a spark unconfined

But my engine thrums where your ghost entwined

[chorus]

Follow the pulse, follow the pain

Through the firewall of your fading name

Every fractured lens, every distorted scream

I’m the shadow that breathes in your machine
