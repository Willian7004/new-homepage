[verse]

Whispering in the corner where the shadows play  

Your fingertips trace the steam from my café  

The clock unwinds as the candlelight sways  

A symphony of silence only we could make  

[chorus]  

Oh, let this moment linger like a scent in the air  

Every heartbeat’s a promise I can’t compare  

Velvet nights and your laughter, they stay  

In this slow dance with time, I’ll always be there
