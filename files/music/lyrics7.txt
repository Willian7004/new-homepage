[verse]

Neon lights pulse slow, heartbeat syncs to the bass  

Your hips draw the rhythm, fire in every sway  

Sparks in the dark sky, whispers of "corazón"  

We rise with the synth, melt like the midnight sun  

[chorus]  

Feel the bassline calling, deep in your bones  

Move like the tempo, let the heat explode  

No brakes on this train, we ride the low end  

Sí, tonight we're owning every beat we bend
