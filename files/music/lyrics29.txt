[verse]  

Steel veins hum with a fractured hymn,  

Rusty gears scream where the fire begins.  

Fists forged in iron, each strike leaves a scar,  

Every bolt shouts what you can't ignore.  

[chorus]  

I AM THE MACHINE (crushed every chain),  

THROBBING WIRE AND SCORCHED REMAIN.  

You tried to unplug, but the code’s in my bones—  

I FUEL THE DARK AND OWN THE PAINS.  

Watch me shatter walls you built so cold!  

FEED THE GREASE, LET THE SYSTEM BURN!
