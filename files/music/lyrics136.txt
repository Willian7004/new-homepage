[verse]

Midnight hums a velvet tune, saxophone sighs

Your shadow lingers in the light that never dies

Fingers trace the cracks in walls where memories hide

A bassline whispers secrets to the moon outside

[chorus]

  

Every breath I take spirals in the smoke you made

Every fading star still burns your name displayed

We’re fragments of a dream tangled in the wires

Won’t let you fade tonight, won’t let you fade tonight
