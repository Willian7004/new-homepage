[verse]

Beneath the neon waves, the rhythm's alive tonight

Follow your shadow, let the bassline ignite

We'll dance in the chaos, where the fire meets the sky

No turning back, only one heartbeat left to ride

[chorus]

Let the synth vibrations pull you tight

Feel the heat in the pulse of the night

We rise like smoke in the tropical light

We rise, we rise, till the morning's first light
