[verse]

Neon pulse on the asphalt, city breath in my veins  

Fingertips trace the spark where synth waves crash the train  

Your heartbeat syncs the rhythm, a secret we share tonight  

Let gravity fade to static—dance like we’re burning white  

[chorus]  

Spin the night, let the bassline breathe  

We’re wildfire in the strobe—no need to repeat  

Synth beats hum a promise, shake the satellites  

Light it up, light it up—our shadows ignite!
