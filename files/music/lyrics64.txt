[verse]

Scorched earth beneath our boots, wires burning blue

Shattered glass and gasoline, I scream this system’s through

Rust in my veins, a rebellion coded deep

I’ll rip the walls you built with teeth you never keep

[chorus]

Burn the grid to ash, let the fractal fires rise

We are the virus in your perfect paradise

No chains, no code, no god to kneel before

Feel the static in your bones—WE ARE THE EXPLOSION
