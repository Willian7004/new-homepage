[verse]

Midnight whispers through a whiskey stream,

Cigarette smoke blurs the walls in mean.

Fingertips trace the ache of yesterday's hymn,

Your shadow lingers where the fire dimmed.

[chorus]

Oh, these blues claw deep in the marrow of my bones,

Slide guitar moans where the daylight’s bones are thrown.

If I could rip the night and rewrite the stars,

I’d trade my shadow for one more dawn with you.
