[verse]

Whispers in the cosmos where the light is hushed,  

Echoes trace the darkness where the earth and heavens brushed,  

Beneath the pulse of constellationsâ€™ ancient song,  

We dissolve to fragments cradled in the endless throng  

[chorus]  

Every breath becomes the wind that whispers through the night,  

Every note dissolves the chains of endless day and light,  

We are echoes in the void where stars have never known,  

Drifting through the silence where the dark and light are sown
