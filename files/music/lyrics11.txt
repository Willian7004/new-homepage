[verse]

Electric pulse in my chest, syncing with the city's breath

Binary constellations bloom where your frequencies dwell

Circuits hum a rhythm only we can trace

Neon veins connect us through this digital space

  

[chorus]

I'm the synthwave shadow trailing every step you take

A data storm igniting every spark you make

You can’t silence this frequency now

I’m the noise inside your circuit

You know this code won’t die now

I’m the glitch you can’t edit
