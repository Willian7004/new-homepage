[verse]

Beneath the crumbling arch of twilight's reign

We trace the echoes where empires burned to stain

The strings of time hum hymns of shattered crowns

A violin's cry through the ashes wears no frown

 

[chorus]

Oh constellation of scars, let your flames ignite

Iâ€™ll carve my vows in the marble of endless night

Through the labyrinth of gods where shadows conspire

Your name is the anthem that shakes every choir
