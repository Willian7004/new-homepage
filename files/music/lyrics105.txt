[verse]  

Steam rises from our breath in minor key spirals  

The sax weeps blue notes where our footprints linger  

Midnight’s a slow-drip cocktail we’re mixing without shame  

Our love’s a clave rhythm no one could ever name  

[chorus]  

Every turn you make, I’ll map the bends in time  

Every spark you steal, becomes my holy shrine  

You can’t outrun this tide now  

I’m the wave behind you  

Every star you chase, I’ll burn twice as bright  

Every fall you face, I’ll meet you in the light  

You know you can’t erase it now  

We’re the melody tonight
