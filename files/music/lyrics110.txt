[verse]

Midnight hum of the keys, whiskey numbs the pain  

Footsteps echo a ghost I can’t contain  

We danced in the neon, now the lights cut through  

Time’s a thief, but the wounds still brew  

[chorus]  

Every road you roam, I’m the shadow at your back  

Every storm you face, I’m the storm you can’t outrun  

The blues in my bones hum your name in the night  

I won’t break, I won’t bend, I’m the fight in the fight
