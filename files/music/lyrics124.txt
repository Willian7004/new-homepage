[verse]

Neon pulse beneath my feet, circuits ignite the night

Sync our palms, frequencies collide—oh we’re burning so bright

Your voice like static in my veins, rewriting the code

We’re glitching through time, a supernova in slow motion

[chorus]

Unplug the sky—let synth waves collide in neon skies

We’re weightless in the dataflow, dancing where the satellites rise

Every error’s a heartbeat, every crash is a spark

I’m the code you can’t delete—let’s crash through the dark
