[verse]

Bleeding crimson through the static veins of this rotten town  

Claws of rage claw through the concrete veins, tearing down  

The machine that feeds on every breath, every spark we stole  

Now we rise with feral teeth, gnawing the bones of your throne whole  

[chorus]  

I won’t fade into the shadows you cast  

I’ll shatter every chain that your empire amassed  

Feel our screams as artillery, piercing through the lies  

We are the wildfire no cage can confine—watch the kingdom burn alive
