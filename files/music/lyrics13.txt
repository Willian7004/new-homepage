[verse]

Shattered bones beneath the crimson rivers flow

Rotting flesh screams where the damned souls below

I carve my wrath through veins of rusted steel

Hell's machinery grinds your worthless tale

[chorus]

Annihilation's hymn! Tear your soul apart!

My jagged axe screams through the flesh you hold so dear

Bleeding kingdoms kneel to the reign of fire

I am the chaos that crushes every prayer
