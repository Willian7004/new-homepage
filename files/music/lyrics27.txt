[verse]

The horizon bleeds in crimson and gold

Heralds whisper of a tale yet untold

Through valleys of shadows, we rise as one

Our banners clash with the setting sun

[chorus]

Rise, let the strings sing of empires reborn

Every scar a verse in this eternal storm

No chain can hold what the heavens have designed

We are the fire that reclaims the divine
