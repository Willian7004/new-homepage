[verse]

Neon lights pulse in the city’s heartbeat

Your voice fades like a distant melody

Synth waves crash through the static of the night

I’m chasing the rhythm, where the futures meet

[chorus]

Feel the pulse in the static, we’re burning so bright

Electric veins racing ahead of the fight

You can’t hide from this fire, it’s written in the code

Never back down, let the chaos explode
