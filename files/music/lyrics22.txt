[verse]

Black veins pulse with venom, shadows claw the night

Fists of fire tear the silence, ignite the war inside

Jagged chains snap like whispers, I spit the hollow lies

You carved your name in scars that bloom like poisoned vines

[chorus]

Watch me carve your name into the flesh of this inferno

Let the acid screams of static melt the skin of heaven

We'll drown in fractured galaxies where the damned ignite

Every shattered sin we steal becomes a crimson requiem
