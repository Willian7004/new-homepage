[verse]

Cappuccino steam weaves velvet sighs tonight

Your shadow lingers in the neon-lit light

A silver spoon stirs silence in my cup

Whispers of a dance we never ended up

[chorus]

Every midnight hum, every note that fades

Your name still echoes through the jazz-blues shades

I trace the cracks in time, you can't outrun

This slow-motion ache, we're both undone
