[verse]

Neon pulse in my veins, the rhythm never fades

Digital heartbeat syncing with the machine's embrace

We’re chasing starlight’s glow, rewriting gravity’s laws

In this electric dawn, our love’s a coded phrase

[chorus]

Every byte of my soul, I’ll ignite the night

Every spark in your code, sets our future alight

You can’t crash this connection now

We’re the fire in the circuit’s hum

Breaking through the silence now

Synergy—we become!
