[verse]

Dusty fields whisper through the pines at dawn

Your laughter lingers where the creek meets the lawn

We chased fireflies in moth-eaten jeans

Now the porch swing creaks where your footprints used to lean

[chorus]

Every mile I roam, I’m still breathin’ that pine

Every hymn I hum, carries your voice through the vines

These roads may bend like the river’s slow grind

But my heart’s always turnin’ back to the line
