[verse]

Sitting on the weathered porch where the twilight whispers low

Strumming an old guitar where your hands used to go

Dusty roads still trace the miles we swore to roam

Now your laughter fades like embers in the unknown

[chorus]

Every mile we rode, I’ll memorize the ache

Every name you chose, I’ll hum in every wake

You can’t outrun this sunset now

I won’t let you go

You know this love’s a shadow now

But I’m still the ghost you know
