[verse]

Scorched veins and diesel breath, I spit static in the storm

Fingertips on burning strings, this rhythm’s got no form

The system cracks like drywall, I laugh at every chain

My soul’s a live wire screaming through the rain

[chorus]

Break every mirror, shatter every rule

I’ll carve my name in lightning, leave my bones in the fuel

You wanna bury me? Dig deeper, motherfucker—watch me rise

A feedback scream in the night, feeding the fire in my eyes
