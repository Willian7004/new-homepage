[verse]

Clutch the rhythm tight where the 808 kicks

No chains on my mind, just the crown where it fits

Ain’t no script for this — raw, uncut, no edits

The game tries to box me? Nah, I’m breakin’ the limits

[chorus]

I’m the shadow on your back when the bullets fly

The heartbeat in the dark, yeah, I’m dyin’ to survive

You can’t bury this fire, it just burns brighter

Every time you doubt, I rise higher, higher
