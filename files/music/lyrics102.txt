[verse]

Steel bones crack, but we rise with the noise

Fistful of gasoline, strike a match and destroy

The anthem's a riot, the rhythm's a blade

We'll carve our names raw in the earth where they fade

[chorus]

Break The Chains, Shatter The Lies!

Scream Into The Sun 'Til The Sky Turns To Crystal

They Tried To Bury Us But We'Ll Erupt From The Grave

Crush The Clockwork World That Traps Us In Slave
