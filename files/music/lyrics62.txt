[verse]

These country roads run deep in my bones

Every mile’s a prayer to a ghost I’ve yet to own

You can’t outrun the echoes of a life half-lived

I’m the shadow that stays when the light’s denied

[chorus]

Every wound’s a river I can’t cross tonight

Every star’s a memory clashing with the light

You can’t bury this heartbeat in the fields we both know

I won’t back down, even if the world won’t let me go
