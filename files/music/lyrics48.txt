[verse]

Dirt beneath my nails, seasons on my hands  

Rows of green whispers where the old road stands  

Beneath the oak we swore, now just bark and scars  

The soil still remembers what the wind won't let go  

[chorus]  

Oh, the earth won't falter, even when the rain forgets  

Her arms hold what winter steals, her pulse beneath the rusted nets  

You can't outrun the harvest, you can't outrun the rot  

But the ground is patient, turning dust to what you're not
