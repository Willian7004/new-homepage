[verse]

Neon pulse in my veins, synth waves in the air

Electric rhythms calling, can't ignore them anymore

Digital heartbeats sync to the bassline's demand

Weâ€™re cyborgs in love with this futuristic land

[chorus]

Ignite the night! Ignite the night!

Let the synth leads hum a symphony of light

Spin like satellites, crash through the sound barrier

Electric guitar riffs scream "break free from gravity!"
