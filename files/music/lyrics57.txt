[verse]

Smoke in the chamber, but I’m loaded with truth

Bulletproof soul, every step screams "I’m the youth"

Punchlines sharp as steel, no filter, no pause

I’m the storm in the dark, lightning wrapped in a clause

[chorus]

I’m the hurricane king, never bending to the throne

My voice cracks the sky, echoes where I’m thrown

Heartbeat syncs with the bass, feel the ground crack

This ain’t just a verse—it’s a war I attack

Unstoppable force, every shadow I own

When the world tries to drown, I’ll build my own thrown
