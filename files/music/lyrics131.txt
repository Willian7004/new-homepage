[verse]

Standing on the cliff where the tides dissolve in gray

Your whisper fractures time, a ghost in the driftwood fray

The hourglass forgot how the sand once fell so slow

Now starlight stitches wounds on the shoreline below

[chorus]

I burn in the static’s breath where distortion meets the sky

Every fractured chord a pulse that refuses to die

The piano’s cold arithmetic climbs the trembling air

We’re echoes in the void but we’ll carve our names there
