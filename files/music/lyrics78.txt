[verse]

Glass shards scream where your promises drowned

Fists of static, fractures in the sound

Bleeding static through the cancerous lies

I am chaos dressed in razor-wired cries

[chorus]

TEAR ME APART! (TEAR!) UNCHAIN THE FIRE!

SHATTER THE GODS WHO BRED THIS LIE!

WEâ€™RE THE SCAR THAT WILL NOT DIE

CRUSH THE CLOCKWORK SKY!

BURN THE FAITH THAT CHOKES THE BEAST

RISE FROM ASH WITH SHATTERED FEAST

OUR CRIES ARE HAMMERS, BLOOD THE FUELS

WATCH THE WORLD EXPLODE IN WRECKLESS TOOLS
