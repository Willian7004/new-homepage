[verse]

Neon pulses kiss my cheeks, city lights collide

Spinning 'round the rainbow hues, chasing paradise

Bubblegum whispers in my pulse, sugar-rush heartbeat

We’re the spark in twilight’s grip, refusing to retreat

[chorus]

Dance like static in the air, synths ignite the town

Every step a comet’s trail, burning all night down

You’re my frequency, my steady synthwave sound

Hands up high—we’re lightning in a candy crown
