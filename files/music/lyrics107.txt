[verse]

Dusty boots on porch rails, tractor’s hum fades slow

Corn stalks bow their heads where we used to row

Pa’s old watch still ticks in the barn’s rusty door

Ghosts of harvest moons haunt the field we ignore

[chorus]

Every sunset’s a memory, every star sings your name

The creek don’t lie, it knows every shame

We were kids in the clover, now the earth claims our bones

But the pines remember, they’ll never let go
