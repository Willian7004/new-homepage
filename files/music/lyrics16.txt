[verse]

Neon veins pulse through the cracked concrete veins

We scream louder than sirens in the gasoline rains

Ripped shirts against the sirens, fists raised in the haze

We’re the matches that shatter the glass cage you made

[chorus]

Burn it down! Let the flames write our names

Every brick we’ve shattered’s a rebellion in flames

You tried to chain the fire but the fuse stays alive

We’ll carve our anthem in the smoke where the satellites dive
