[verse]

Faded photographs line the dusty attic floor

Your voice still echoes through the walls of my front door

We danced in the glow of a neon-lit diner

Now the jukebox whispers, "Baby, don't you remember?"

[chorus]

Every heartbeat hums the melody of our mistakes

Every shadow stretches like the hands of sacred days

You can't outrun these memories now

They burn too bright

I trace your silhouette where the moonlight meets the night
