[verse]

Crackling chords ignite the air

In the battlefield of blood and rust

Every scar a half-written war cry

Drowning in the static of our cursed past

[chorus]

Rip the mask of lies apart (tear it down!)

Let the fractures bleed through the dark (let them burn!)

We are the storm that shatters steel

Crashing through the walls they built so real

I won’t kneel, I won’t kneel
