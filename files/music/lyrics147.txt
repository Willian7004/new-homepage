[verse]

Skeletal claws rip through the static of my veins

Barbed wire screams in sync with the amp's electric rain

A molten fist punches through the rot of hollow days

Echoes of my rage crack the spine of this decay

[chorus]

Break the chains of silence, shatter the lies we bled

Drag the fury forth where the fractured truths are fed

In the furnace of this chaos, let my bones collide

We are the storm that drowns the god who made us bleed!

Break the god who made us bleed!
