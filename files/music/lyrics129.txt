[verse]

Silent strings unravel constellations above

Earth and sky collide in a tempest of love

Bowing bows carve the air where shadows once hid

A thousand hearts rise where the fractured light split

[chorus]

Crescendo of bows! Crescendo of bows!

Thunder roars through the ribs of the earth below

Copper horns scream where the ancient winds go

Flames of resolve where the mortal notes flow
